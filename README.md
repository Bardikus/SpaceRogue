# SpaceRogue
Bachelor Project - Roguelike video game

Project realized in GameMaker Studio 2.0. Language used: GML (GameMaker Language).

SpaceRogue is my Bachelor project. It is a 2D, top-down, shooter & survival game with roguelike elements. 
The game levels are procedurally generated based on an custom, self-made algorithm on each game execution.
